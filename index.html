    <p>Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code,[9] is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.[10] Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.</p>

    <p>console. log specifically is a method for developers to write code to inconspicuously inform the developers what the code is doing. It can be used to alert you that there's an issue, but shouldn't take the place of an interactive debugger when it comes time to debug the code.
